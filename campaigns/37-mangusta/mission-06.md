## Common Objectives

**Destroy the power station (5 pts)** 

The city is powered by an electrical power station located in downtown Bolabongo. The facilities are very simple and not protected.
The power cut would provide a great advantage to the US forces over their ennemies, so that they may capture one of the most important Russian military bases.

*Victory condition:* US Army must destroy the both power units before the end of the mission, meanwhile Russian forces have to keep them operating.


# Capture Area

**Capture military base of Bolabongo (3 pts)**  

The Bolabongo military base is one of the biggest in the northern country. A lot of equipments and operational units are hosted there, and the majority of operations were led from this base.

*Victory condition:* at the very end of the 2-hours long mission, units inside the area (accurate boundaries displayed on map) are counted, and the points go to the side who has at least 1 player more than the other side. No points taken if no one in zone.
