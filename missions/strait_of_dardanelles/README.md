# Synopsis

Bozcaada is a Turkish island with a strategic location in the Aegean Sea, closed to the Strait of Dardanelles. Many battles were led to take control over Turkish straits: they give an access to the Mediterranean Sea, which is crucial for the Russian fleet in Black Sea.

Thus, Russian Forces has settled down in the small island for decades, making the area secure. The White House took the intiative to occupy the sourthern part of Bozcaada 5 years ago. The plans were to counter-balance the Russian military power in this strategic place. They took advantage of a NATO charity program to support local population, and managed to control a small territory after hard negociations.  

The situation has remained calm until now, but huge amount of military equipements are brought to the deployed Russian Forces, but US Army does not appreciate so much.

# Task Orders

## USA specific Objectives

#### Destroy ZSU-23 SHILKA (5 pts)

Closed to the Merkez capital, Russian Forces deployed some units in charge of the city security. An AAA ZSU-23 Shilka unit is part of the forces. American Forces would like to lead air operations with Blackhawks, but this AAA is a danger that must be eliminated first.

Victory condition: vehicle must be destroyed at the end of the game. There is a marker on map indicating the exact location of the Shilka.

## Russia specific Objectives

#### Get the report (5 pts)

US Forces are in minority but well-organized. Every day, border-keepers write a report about Russian activities. The Command wants to read such reports to know what the ennemy discovered about current activities and the reinforcement of the facilities.

These documents are located in a small house which is used as a local HQ closed to the beach of Tekirbahce Koyu.

Only Russian players have a contextual action on the documents located on a desk on the first floor.

When someone executes the action, the documents disappear, a message is displayed, and points are given.

![img](http://zupimages.net/up/16/44/sefa.png)

Victory condition: action must be done before the end of the game. There is a marker on map indicating the exact location of the documents.

## Common Objectives

### Capture Merkez downtown (3 pts)

US Forces want to stop the reinforcement of the Russian facilities ; the reliable supplies transit by sea, then are unloaded in the harbour of Merkez, then stored in the old market place. USA will try to capture the area, while Russians will try to keep the place safe.

*Victory condition:* at the very end of the 2-hours long mission, units inside the area (accurate boundaries displayed on map) are counted, and the points go to the side who has at least 1 player more than the other side. No points taken if no one in zone.

# Game Rules

* One-Life-Project choose the side.
* the winner is the one who gets the higher score: there are 8 pts
to earn with objectives, and 2 pts of supremacy (=the opponents
soldiers are 5 or less alive in the end, that means that we killed
most of them). So, each side will have a total score on /10 pts.
* No-respawn, Elite mode
* Duration: 2 hours
* No IA (missing people won't be replaced by IA), but enable the IA under your slot to reconnect at the same location if you face disconnection.
* Spectator script is available, please join the “Ghost” dedicated TS3
channel, and enjoy the show ! Be smart and don't provide information to your in-game mates, it is not a competition, faithfullness is the rule.


# Game startup procedure

## 1. Slots

From **20h55**, all players can slot themselves on the OFCRA server (password will be communicated before).
Use *only* the slots chosen by your tactics, and enable the IA on the used slots. Disable all other IA.


## 2. Vehicles choice

The mission will be launched at **21h15**, you spawn at your unique spawn, players can still connect, but Platoon Sergeant and all of the Squad Leaders (convenient if Platoon Sergeant is late or faces troubles when connecting) have an extra ACE menu item to open the interactive panel.

![img](http://www.ofcrav2.org/images/Campagne/37-mangusta/startup_process_01.png)

Both sides have to select their vehicles (check the Order of Battles to see your options).

![img](http://www.ofcrav2.org/images/Campagne/37-mangusta/startup_process_02.png)

Since there is only one spawn for each side in the mission, there is no spawn to choose.
Below, you need to select you vehicles: you have limitations (you can select only one means of transportation for each Rifle Squad), but you also have free vehicles at your spawn.

Once your vehicles selected (= are in the list on the right side), click *Execute*,  and this will delete all the vehicles at your spawn BUT the one that you selected. Only one guy must click on Execute (normally the Platoon Sergeant), so for the 3 or 4 Squad Leaders, please don't use the interactive panel if there is someone already doing it, and let the unique guy in charge of the vehicles selection launch the process once.

If you did a mistake (wrong vehicles + click on *Execute* button), then we immediately re-launch the mission.


## 3. Warm-up

Once a side has finished with interactive panel, a message will be displayed to warn everybody that the side is ready to start the warm-up. Please do it very fast.

![img](http://www.ofcrav2.org/images/Campagne/37-mangusta/startup_process_03.png)

Once both sides are ready, the unselected vehicles are deleted from spawn for both sides, and the warm-up starts:

![img](http://www.ofcrav2.org/images/Campagne/37-mangusta/startup_process_04.png)

Platoon and Squads leaders have the ability to stop the warm-up and start the mission immediately (if both sides are ready).

* Warmup duration: 15 min.
* Warmup zone restriction: 200 m. (your player can walk away from his spawn location with restriction: he will be teleported back to the spawning location if he goes outside of the 200m circle around his spawn.)

Players can continue to join the game.
Units can move in a large area to let them join their vehicle. All vehicles are locked, but inventory can be accessed.
At the end of the warm-up, all vehicles are unlocked and the mission starts, with the time when the mission will be stopped. The ACE menu is now vanilla.

![img](http://www.ofcrav2.org/images/Campagne/37-mangusta/startup_process_05.png)

After the 2 hours, the scoreboard is computed and displayed to all players:

![img](http://www.ofcrav2.org/images/Campagne/37-mangusta/screens/arma3%202016-10-27%2023-49-28-38.png)

You will have computed scores (error is always possible, but we will ask the spectator to know if objectives are done in this case), and the list of survivors.
