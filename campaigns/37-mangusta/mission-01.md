## Common Objectives

**Murder of Billy DITOUGADI (5 pts)**  

![obj](http://www.ofcrav2.org/images/Campagne/37-mangusta/billy_id.png)

This man is the mayor of the small town of Vestinga. Russian Intel Services don't know so much about him, he is an ordinary husband living in a small town with a very classic life. He does repair works on his house currently, and lives temporarly at his brother's home, in Katakabi. He works as a bank employee in the downtown of the Simbala. We don't know where he will be this morning, either in Katakabi or at work. Two markers indicate on map the exact 2 possible positions.

Billy DITOUGADI is an IA unit who cannot move. He will be teleported at mission start randomly on one of these two locations.
After 1H and 30 MIN, the TV news will alert the population about the Russian attack, so that Billy will disappear and cannot be killed anymore. In this case, victory goes to USA.

*Victory condition:* Russian have to kill the IA before 07h30 loc. time, and USA have to protect him.


# Capture Area

**Capture of Vestinga (3 pts)**  

Vestinga town is ideally located on a small Swazilian island, closed to the border. Taking the control of this island means controlling the main access to the North-West region of the Democratic Republic of Bongobo, where industries and military facilities settled massively. Russian troops want to settle down in Vestinga, but USA forces have to defend their territory from the enemy agressions.

*Victory condition:* at the very end of the 2-hours long mission, units inside the area (boundaries displayed on map) are counted, and the points go to the side who has at least 1 player more than the other side. No points taken if no one in zone.
