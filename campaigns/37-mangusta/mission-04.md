MSV has an important FOB located in the jungle near Engor. There is an action for every US players on the power generator to make it inoperative. This generator is mandatory to start helicopters engines.

*Victory condition:* US army has to execute the action on the (indestructible) generator before the end of the mission, and Russians have to prevent it.


# Capture Area

**Capture Pumado Base (3 pts)**  

MSV occupies a military base located closed to Pumado village. This base is very important for Russian armored vehicles since it is a centralized repair center.  
US Army will try to catch the base wmeanwhile Russian forces have to defend it. The zone is a small part of the facilities to suit our forces size.
