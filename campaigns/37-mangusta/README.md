# Synopsis

## Isla Duala, 1999/2016 
Russians have been occupying the northern part of the Island from 15 years, while USA had done the same with the southern part in the middle of the last century. 
There had been two different states before: the Democratic Republic of Bongobo, and Swazili state. The later has been led by the dictator called Paul Papaoutai. Americans decided to free people and took the administration ; they got much more issues than benefits. The White House is still facing many troubles with Swazilians.

Recently, Kremlin decided to take the control of  the DRB (Democratic Republic of Bongobo) which is a rich land with petrol resources. The industry have been nicely developed for dozen years. Several troubles have broken the quietness of the peaceful countries, closed to the border in-between. Economical difficulties have implications worldwide.

## Russian Operations Center - Pinley, 2016-09-05
Only the clock hand breaks the profound silence of meeting room B-36. Dark eyes browse the whole assembly of ranked commanders. No one is missing. Time is up, the conclusion is delivered by an embarrassed voice:<br>- "Da." says General K.<br>All of them know how hard the task will be, and how big the troubles could become. The biggest military operation of the History will threaten the Island of Duala soon: Russia is ready to expanse his territory by invading Swazili.

## US HQ - Camara, 2016-09-06
An extremely important document is given to Général A. GRANT, officer from Washington to administrate Swazili state under American supervision.
The tape is an audio record about a secret meeting of Russian Commanders which happened yesterday. Both the translators feel annoyed about what they are listening to: Russians are going to lead an invasion and take the power on the whole island. The alert level is immediately raised to the maximum, and mobilization of military forces all along the border is on-the-go.

## Kinsela Airport, Swazili - 2016-11-26
Airborne division have been assigned to Swazili theater to support local forces. One C-130J Hercule landed at Kinsella Airport this afternoon. The aircraft provides tactical paradrop abilities for next missions in the campaign.

# Campaign Rules

## Keys

* 33 vs 33
* 2RGT chooses his side
* **10 pts** per mission
  * **5 pts:** primary objective
  * **3 pts:** captured area
  * **2 pts:** supremacy bonus (<=5 survivors in the enemy side)
* The winner is the first to score **30 pts**
* Unknown nulber of missions (x3 at least)
* No IA at all
* Unique spawn location for each side, far from objectives to prevent from rushing


The goal of this campaign is to propose a fight with mechanized/motorised rifle squads, humans only, no rush, with objectives to avoid inactivity.

## Vehicles Loss Management

Distances are big, and rifle squads will loose their means of transportation, sometimes. To let them be back in the game easily, it is up to teamplay and Platoon Leader should organize units moves (helping with his own car or coordinating with other squads). There is also an additional solution: civilian trucks are spread all over the map.

# Game startup procedure

## 1. Slots

From **20h55**, all players can slot themselves on the OFCRA server (password will be communicated before).
Use *only* the slots chosen by your tactics. There are only 5 groups:


* [YANKEE or ZULU] Platoon Sergeant: mandatory
* [ALPHA or ROMEO] Rifle Squad 1: mandatory, if the chosen vehicle requires 2 crews, you have to slots humans on these 2 slots. If you have missing guys, free slots will remain in infantry slots.
* [BRAVO or SIERRA] Rifle Squad 2: mandatory, if the chosen vehicle requires 2 crews, you have to slots humans on these 2 slots. If you have missing guys, free slots will remain in infantry slots.
* [CHARLIE or TANGO] Rifle Squad 3: mandatory, if the chosen vehicle requires 2 crews, you have to slots humans on these 2 slots. If you have missing guys, free slots will remain in infantry slots.
* [DELTA or QUEBEC] Rifle Squad 4: optional, if the chosen vehicle requires 2 crews, you have to slots humans on these 2 slots. If you have missing guys, free slots will remain in infantry slots.
* [WHISKEY or VICTOR] Completion Squad: optional, if used, you must occupy the slots from the top to the bottom = If you have 5 guys in this group, the slots will be the 5th first ones.


All IA will be disabled (*if you loose connection, you will find your unit at the same location, if not dead*).


## 2. Vehicles choice

The mission will be launched at **21h15**, you spawn at your unique spawn, players can still connect, but Platoon Sergeant and all of the Squad Leaders (convenient if Platoon Sergeant is late or faces troubles when connecting) have an extra ACE menu item to open the interactive panel.

![img](http://www.ofcrav2.org/images/Campagne/37-mangusta/startup_process_01.png)

Both sides have to select their vehicles.

![img](http://www.ofcrav2.org/images/Campagne/37-mangusta/startup_process_02.png)

Since there is only one spawn for each side in the mission, there is no spawn to choose.
Below, you need to select you vehicles: be smart and respect the vehicles combination that you decided, I mean, there is a maximum of 4 vehicles (1 per group minus the M-1097 half of the Platoon Commander that should NOT BE SELECTED on that panel, since it will be always available without any action) and there is a maximum number for each vehicle class. But you still can add 2x Blackhawks + 2x M-113, which should not be possible in the campaign rules.

Once your vehicles selected (= are in the list on the right side), click *Execute*,  and this will delete all the vehicles at your spawn BUT the one that you selected. Only one guy must click on Execute (normally the Platoon Sergeant), so for the 4 Squad Leaders, please don't use the interactive panel if there is someone already doing it, and let the unique guy in charge of the vehicles selection launch the process once.

If you did a mistake (wrong vehicles + click on *Execute* button), then we immediately re-launch the mission.

## 3. Warm-up

Once a side has finished with interactive panel, a message will be displayed to warn everybody that the side is ready to start the warm-up. Please do it very fast.

![img](http://www.ofcrav2.org/images/Campagne/37-mangusta/startup_process_03.png)

Once both sides are ready, the unselected vehicles are deleted from spawn for both sides, and the warm-up starts:

![img](http://www.ofcrav2.org/images/Campagne/37-mangusta/startup_process_04.png)

Platoon and Squads leaders have the ability to stop the warm-up and start the mission immediately.

* duration: 15 min.
* zone restriction: 400 m.

Players can continue to join the game.
Units can move in a large area to let them join their vehicle. All vehicles are closed (inventory can be accessed only).
At then end of the warm-up, all vehicles are unlocked and the mission starts. The ACE menu is now vanilla.

To help you to find your vehicle, here after are the bases for both sides:

## Groups and Slots

The composition of the groups is based on the choice of the vehicle for the given group.
Whatever happens, there must be **exactly 33 players** per side.

| ![USA](http://www.ofcrav2.org/images/publiques/flag_usa.jpg) | ![Russia](http://www.ofcrav2.org/images/publiques/flag_russia.jpg) |

| **Example:**<br>Commander is mandatory, let's consider the 32 remaining slots and the 3 RS first:<br><br>I choose 1x M-117 for RS1, 1x RG-33 for RS2, 1x (2x M-1025) for RS3 and for the remaining slots, we will see later our options.<br>**RS 1:** M-117 has 2x ground crews + 5x infantry units => I must select the 5 first slots into the RS.<br>**RS 2:** RG-33 has 8 infantry units without crew<br>**RS 3:** M-1025 (M2) + M-1025 (MK19) have  8x infantry units without crew<br>**RS 4:** I already have 23 slots within the 3 first RS., it lacks 32 - 23 = 9 slots.<br><br>I cannot choose the M-113, because it requires 10 slots. I can choose any vehicle that takes 9 slots or less. Of course, I must have enough vehicles in regards to the restrictions. I choose here 1x M2A3.<br><br>After my 4 RS completed, It still lacks 1 slot. This is why the **Completion group** exists: you have to select the right number of slots to get 32 slots (+1 Platoon Sergeant) selected.<br><br>So, I will have an additional Squad Leader in *Whiskey* that can help the Platoon Sergeant or join another RS.<br>Completion Group has 1x M-1097 without any other possible choice.<br><br>In the end, my Orders of Battles are:<br>![usa](http://www.ofcrav2.org/images/publiques/campagne/mangusta/usa_groups_example_01.png)<br><br>**Remarks:**<br>- The Platoon Sergeant has 1x M-1097-half (6 seats) for himself<br>- If RS1 and RS2 were equipped with M-113, the RS3 would be disabled (you can use a RS **only** if you can select a vehicle and the exact number of slots that the vehicle requires, as described above), and the 4 missing slots would be the 4 first ones in the Completion Group.<br>- The 4 RS can be used with of 7, 8 or 10 slots only.<br>- In case of UH-60M, choose aircrew team instead of ground crew. | **Example:**<br>Commander is mandatory, let's consider the 32 remaining slots and the 4 RS first:<br>I choose 1x Mi-8MT for RS 1, 1x BRDM-2 for RS2 2, 1x GAZ-233011 for RS3 and for the remaining slots, we will see later our options.<br><br>**RS 1:** Mi-8MT has 2x aircrews + 7 infantry units => I must select all of them.<br>**RS 2:** BRDM-2 has 2x ground crews + 7 infantry units => I must select all of them.<br>**RS 3:** I must select the 7 infantry units, no crew.<br>**RS 4:** I still have to select 32-(9+9+7)= 7 slots, so I can use this group with either 1x BRDM-2 (AT), 1x GAZ-233011, or 1x UAZ.<br><br>Imagine that I chosed 1x BTR-80 for my RS3 instead ; 32-(9+9+9)= 5 slots for RS4. I cannot use RS4 since it provides 7 or 9 slots only....this is why the **Completion group** exists: you have to select the right number of slot to get 32 slots (+1 Platoon Sergeant) selected.<br>So, I will have *VICTOR* with 5 units.<br>Completion group has 1x UAZ-open, no other possible choice.<br><br>In the end, my Orders of Battles are:<br>![img](http://www.ofcrav2.org/images/publiques/campagnes/mangusta/ru_groups_example_01.png)<br><br>**Remarks:**<br>- The Platoon Sergeant has 1x UAZ (7 seats) for himself<br>- The 4 RS can be used with 7 or 9 slots only.<br>- In case of Mi-8MT, use aircrew instead of ground crew. |
