# Synopsis

## Isla Duala, 1999/2016 
Russians have been occupying the northern part of the Island from 15 years, while USA had done the same with the southern part in the middle of the last century. 
There had been two different states before: the Democratic Republic of Bongobo, and Swazili state. The later has been led by the dictator called Paul Papaoutai. Americans decided to free people and took the administration ; they got much more issues than benefits. The White House is still facing many troubles with Swazilians.

Recently, Kremlin decided to take the control of  the DRB (Democratic Republic of Bongobo) which is a rich land with petrol resources. The industry have been nicely developed for dozen years. Several troubles have broken the quietness of the peaceful countries, closed to the border in-between. Economical difficulties have implications worldwide.

## Russian Operations Center - Pinley, 2016-15-05
Only the clock hand breaks the profound silence of meeting room B-36. Dark eyes browse the whole assembly of ranked commanders. No one is missing. Time is up, the conclusion is delivered by an embarrassed voice:<br>- "Da." says General K.<br>All of them know how hard the task will be, and how big the troubles could become. The biggest military operation of the History will threaten the Island of Duala soon: Russia is ready to expanse his territory by invading Swazili.

## US HQ - Camara, 2016-15-06
An extremely important document is given to Général A. GRANT, officer from Washington to administrate Swazili state under American supervision.
The tape is an audio record about a secret meeting of Russian Commanders which happened yesterday. Both the translators feel annoyed about what they are listening to: Russians are going to lead an invasion and take the power on the whole island. The alert level is immediately raised to the maximum, and mobilization of military forces all along the border is on-the-go.

# Campaign Rules

## Keys

* 33 vs 33
* 2RGT chooses his side
* **10 pts** per mission
  * **5 pts:** primary objective
  * **3 pts:** captured area
  * **2 pts:** supremacy bonus (<=5 survivors in the enemy side)
* The winner is the first to score **30 pts**
* Unknown nulber of missions (x3 at least)
* No IA at all
* Unique spawn location for each side, far from objectives to prevent from rushing


The goal of this campaign is to propose a fight with mechanized/motorised rifle squads, humans only, no rush, with objectives to avoid inactivity.

## Vehicles Loss Management

Distances are big, and rifle squads will loose their means of transportation, sometimes. To let them be back in the game easily, it is up to teamplay and Platoon Leader should organize units moves (helping with his own car or coordinating with other squads). There is also an additional solution: civilian trucks are spread all over the map.

# Game startup procedure

## 1. Slots

From **20h55**, all players can slot themselves on the OFCRA server (password will be communicated before).
Use *only* the slots chosen by your tactics. There are only 5 groups:


* [YANKEE or ZULU] Platoon Sergeant: mandatory
* [ALPHA or ROMEO] Rifle Squad 1: mandatory, if the chosen vehicle requires 2 crews, you have to slots humans on these 2 slots. If you have missing guys, free slots will remain in infantry slots.
* [BRAVO or SIERRA] Rifle Squad 2: mandatory, if the chosen vehicle requires 2 crews, you have to slots humans on these 2 slots. If you have missing guys, free slots will remain in infantry slots.
* [CHARLIE or TANGO] Rifle Squad 3: mandatory, if the chosen vehicle requires 2 crews, you have to slots humans on these 2 slots. If you have missing guys, free slots will remain in infantry slots.
* [DELTA or QUEBEC] Rifle Squad 4: optional, if the chosen vehicle requires 2 crews, you have to slots humans on these 2 slots. If you have missing guys, free slots will remain in infantry slots.
* [WHISKEY or VICTOR] Completion Squad: optional, if used, you must occupy the slots from the top to the bottom = If you have 5 guys in this group, the slots will be the 5th first ones.


All IA will be disabled (*if you loose connection, you will find your unit at the same location, if not dead*).


## 2. Vehicles choice

The mission will be launched at **21h15**, you spawn at your unique spawn, players can still connect, but Platoon Sergeant and all of the Squad Leaders (convenient if Platoon Sergeant is late or faces troubles when connecting) have a windows immediately after their spawning:

Since there is only one spawn for each side in the mission, there is no spawn to choose.
Below, you need to select you vehicles: be smart and respect the vehicles combination that you decided, I mean, there is a maximum of 4 vehicles (1 per group minus the M-1097 half of the Platoon Commander that should NOT BE SELECTED on that panel, since it will be always available without any action) and there is a maximum number for each vehicle class. But you still can add 2x Blackhawks + 2x M-113, which should not be possible in the campaign rules.

Once your vehicles selected (= are in the list on the right side), click *Execute*,  and this will delete all the vehicles at your spawn BUT the one that you selected. Only one guy must click on Execute (normally the Platoon Sergeant), so for the 4 Squad Leaders, just click on [i]Cancel[/i], and let the unique guy in charge of the vehicles selection launch the process once.

If you did a mistake (wrong vehicles + click on *Execute* button), then we immediately re-launch the mission.

## 3. Warm-up

Once both sides are ready, the unselected vehicles are deleted from spawn for both sides, and the warm-up starts:

* duration: 15 min.
* zone restriction: 400 m.

Players can continue to join the game.
Units can move in a large area to let them join their vehicle. All vehicles are closed (inventory can be accessed only).
At then end of the warm-up, all vehicles are unlocked and the mission starts.

To help you to find your vehicle, here after are the bases for both sides:
